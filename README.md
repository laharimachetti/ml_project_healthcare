# 📚 Machine Learning (ML) Lifecycle  

Machine Learning (ML) is not just about building a model — it is a complete process that follows several important phases. Each phase plays a crucial role in making sure the final solution is accurate, reliable, and useful.  

### 🔑 Phases of ML  
1. **Problem Definition**  
2. **Data Collection**  
3. **Data Preprocessing**  
4. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
5. **Model Selection**  
6. **Model Training**  
7. **Model Evaluation**  
8. **Deployment**  
9. **Monitoring & Maintenance**

## 📝 Health Insurance Cost Predictor – Project Overview  

### 📌 Project Statement  
The rising cost of healthcare has made insurance planning a crucial part of financial security. However, estimating the premium or cost of health insurance can be complex, as it depends on multiple personal and lifestyle factors.  

The goal of this project is to **predict health insurance costs** for individuals based on their demographic details, health indicators, and lifestyle habits.  

---

### ⚙️ Tech Stack Used  
The project integrates multiple tools and frameworks across the ML lifecycle:  

- **Python** → Core programming language  
- **Libraries**:  
  - Pandas, NumPy → Data preprocessing & feature engineering  
  - Scikit-learn → ML models & pipeline building  
  - XGBoost → Gradient boosting algorithm for best performance  
  - Matplotlib → Visualization (exploratory data analysis)  
  - Joblib → Saving & loading trained models  
- **Streamlit** → Building the interactive front-end app  
- **Streamlit Cloud** → App deployment on the web  

---

### 📊 Results Achieved  
- Successfully built and trained an ML model to predict health insurance costs with **good accuracy** (evaluated using metrics like **Mean Squared Error (MSE)** and **R² Score**).  
- Build and compared different models (Linear Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost) and choose the best one for deployment.  
- The model generalizes well and provides predictions that align with realistic cost patterns (e.g., higher costs for smokers or those with chronic conditions).

### 🚀 Deployment  
The app was deployed using **Streamlit Cloud**, making it accessible to anyone with an internet connection.
